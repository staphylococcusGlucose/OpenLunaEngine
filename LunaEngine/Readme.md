## Precautions for development

For various platforms, the core part needs to be written in pure Lua. Also, the platform-dependent part is made to operate by creating intermediate interfaces, etc

## Other matters

The main language of the person who opened this repository is not English. So, I'm using an interpreter in many parts, including Readme and annotation, so some awkward expressions may appear, and some of the annotations may contain Korean, but I hope you understand it generously
